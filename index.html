                <h2>Kansas City</h2>
                <p><strong>Kansas City</strong> is home to me. It is the right size city where there is a lot of stuff to do, but it's not so busy that there are people everywhere. It has some of the best <strong>barbeque</strong> on the planet and you get the nice midwest hospital.</p>
